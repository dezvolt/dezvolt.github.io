              <p>There have been a few moments over the past week where I thought, "Why didn't I just use a template?" But I wanted to work through it from scratch - just me and VSCode. Though far from finished, I'm finally at a point where I consider this site <em>settled</em>. I can leave it for a little while without worrying about everything it's missing. There's still quite a bit to do, but I'm in no rush.</p>

              <p>I need to sort out <em>responsive design</em>. I got so frustrated with my front page and the way it rendered on mobile that I said, "Screw it," set :root font-size to 1vw and used <em>rem</em> for everything. Mobile users can squint or turn it landscape for all I care right now. Man, I was annoyed at the way everything got jumbled. Anyway, I could either refactor or throw in some media queries. I'll likely start with the latter, though both will eventually be necessary. I've since read that you should "design for mobile first." Lesson learned.</p>

              <p>Really, as the front page says, this is just for me to try things out. Take this blog, for example. It in no way follows any of the "best practices" lists you see all over the place. There's no thought for SEO, no <em>hooks</em>, interesting lists, images, etc. If the CRT effect (which I love, by the way) is an issue, I've added a toggle in the upper-right. Beyond that, it is what it is. No CMS, no Jekyll, no database, just words in the html.</p>

              <p>So, what happens now? Build a site, learn some languages, and do what with it all? Well, I can't quit my day job and seek out a jr. dev role for 1/3 of my current salary, regardless of how much I like this stuff. Mouths to feed and all that. I think I'll just continue learning and working on stuff for the fun of it. I'll likely seek out some interesting open source projects and see if I can contribute. I also have some ideas for personal projects. All in good time.</p>

              <p>I intend to document my learning journey here, with all the mistakes and little victories. Other than that, I might include some CTF write-ups. Cybersecurity is a fascinating field and I learn a lot by digging through those mock sites, playing with Burp, and finding the flags.</p>
